# Introduction

In a globalized world where new information and trends emerge all the time, people's lives began to demand to be updated about everything all the time, leading most people to wear out at the end of the day. For their leisure time, many are looking for the simplest alternative that will bring them more fun in a short period of time, which, most of the time, turns out to be movies and series, the much-talked-about streaming, where new content and content are released daily. always seeks to cater to all tastes, according to a survey[^1] by the FX Research institute, in 2021 there were 559 series in production and 496 shown, all of this in the US alone.

Consuming this type of entertainment gives people pleasure, bringing a great sense of reward to our brain, a feeling similar to the one we have when we do something we like in our daily lives, as pointed out by the experiment[^2] at the University College of London carried out in 2019, where it is pointed out that 55% of the volunteers who participated in the experiment believe that the experience of spending two hours watching movies was “therapeutic on an emotional level and felt an increase in happiness”, 75% felt fully involved in the movies, and 45 % felt refreshed at the end of the two hours. Given this, the experiment concludes that “movies are one of the only places left where you can step outside of reality and disconnect from problems.”

Human beings are always in search of that pleasure, a thought which leads us to believe that repeating this practice of watching the same movie that we like recurrently, in search of more and more pleasure, encouraging people to look for other movies similar to the ones they liked the most .

Faced with such analyses, there is a need for ways and mechanisms to find these “twin” films, a platform for indicating titles that considers not only genres, models or styles, but also the social consensus on which films and series are really similar. , in a way that consumes the least possible user time, while delivering the most practical experience possible.

## Problem
Most people who consume movies don't like it when they end up watching something and in the end they feel frustrated that it's not what they expected.

Currently there are no means to find related films, and those that exist are difficult to understand, creating a big problem that consumes a lot of time and ends up even annoying the person who searches, where, most of the time, he ends up finding several films of the same genre. , however, does not get the information of which one is really similar, and how similar it is.

In this way, the problem to be solved is the lack of mechanisms that connect related movies from a user profile.

This is made explicit in a survey we conducted, where more than 75% of respondents responded that they end up finding other similar films based on their genre, which makes up the response to the rate of over 95% of dissatisfaction observed in relation to films who watched it expecting it to be one way, however, in the end they were totally different, just wasting their time, which has already been shortened already in the research part of the related film, as pointed out by the accumulated answers of more than 57% of the interviewees, which responded that some take from 16 minutes to even more than an hour to find a movie they like, that is, if they are going to watch a 120-minute movie, it takes, on average, a quarter of the feature film just looking for it .

## Objectivs

The general objective of this work is to create a web application that enables the connection of related movies from user profiles.

As specific objectives we have:

-	Identification of user profiles
-	Linking movies to user profiles

## Justifications

Most internet users do research before making their decisions. In a survey[^3] carried out in 2017 by AvellareDuarte Consultoria, it is stated that 73% of respondents search the internet before making a purchase, and 64% of those who accessed the internet in the last week believe that consulting the opinions of other people on the internet would help make important purchasing decisions.

In this way, a significant percentage of respondents understood that researching before making their decisions is crucial to increase the chances of getting it right at the time of choice, with the convenience of Internet access being more important than its price.

By crossing such analyses, it is possible to draw a line that leads to the conclusion that people would definitely research before investing their time in a film that will not satisfy them, often looking for this recommendation on best movies compilation sites, or crossing the genres they like, however, there is a high chance that these people will end up not finding a movie similar to the one they watched previously and want the same experience.


## Target Audience

Watching movies and series has become a new pastime for most people, our research has shown that even people not born in the “age of technology”, i.e. during the 2000s, have converted to streaming. The rate of people interviewed who are between 21 and 40 years old adds up to more than 68% of the responses, in addition, according to a recent survey[^4] by Kantar Ibope Media, the times when people watch videos the most are 6:00 pm and 22:00 hours these are when people are arriving home after a long day of work or study.

Younger people are also not out of scope, since, being a form of entertainment for the whole family, it is understood that films, series and other similar products cover practically the entire population and possibly all ages, from the youngest to the oldest.

Bearing this in mind, the focus of this work is on young-adults and adults from all groups and social classes, who have part of their time occupied with work or studies, with interests in this type of entertainment, and who would like to have new recommendations based on in their own interest so that they don't have the wear and tear of having to look for a movie or series that fits their taste, having them ready and listed.
