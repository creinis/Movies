# Methodology

The methodology itself is one of the most important parts for the development of the project, because, “with organization and time, one finds the secret of doing everything and doing it well.” (PYTHAGORAS). With that in mind, the team decided to make use of several tools, such as organization, agility, code maintenance, communication, among others, which are mentioned in this topic.

## List of Work Environments
Every tool has its purpose; the following table will explain in which environment, and for what, the team used them.

## Version control

The version control tool adopted in the project was the
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), whereas [Github](https://github.com)
was used for hosting the repository.

The project follows the following convention for naming branches:


- `main`: already tested stable version of the software
- `unstable`: already tested version of the software, but unstable
- `testing`: testing version of the software
- `dev`: software development version

As for issue management, the project adopts the following convention to
hang tags:

- `documentation`: improvements or additions to the documentation
- `bug`: a feature has problems
- `enhancement`: a feature needs to be improved
- `feature`: a new feature needs to be introduced

## Project Management

### Division of Roles
Aiming to carry out as many tasks as possible in the shortest possible time, the team chose to adopt agile methodologies, more specifically Scrum to define how the development process will work, because with it everyone in the group can work in a creative and adaptable way, where one A team member is in charge of exercising one, or more, clear functions and responsibilities, assigned to him by himself at each stage of the project, with the aim of finally bringing all the parts together and reaching the final result in the most harmonious way.

With Scrum, we will also use principles from the Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF), which is a flexible framework created to guide software development projects. In it, there are some mindsets that we implement together with the Scrum principles, the two working in a compatible way, since MSF acts in the development management part and Scrum in the project organization part. The mindsets that will be used:

+ **Quality defined by the customer:** Since the site is to help the user based on the notes of other users, it is extremely important that they give their continuous feedback, so that the site improves based on them.


+ **Team in pairs:** It is unlikely that one person will develop all parts of the project perfectly in a timely manner, so you will have many parts in pairs to speed up development and improve overall quality.


+ **Frequent version releases:** The faster a part of the site is developed, the faster it can be tested, used, revised, and potentially rebuilt with improvements.


+ **I want to learn:** developing a website is not an easy task, it requires time, knowledge and a lot of dedication. Every day, project members will have to learn a new skill, always seeking to evolve individually to deliver better quality.


+ **Pride in individual work:** works together with the previous mindset, since, with each new learning experience, the member feels fulfilled for being able to masterfully perform a task that previously seemed impossible, thus achieving more and more help with the project and feel good about yourself in the process.

The organization of the team is as follows:

+ Scrum Master: Álvaro Emanuel
+ Product Owner: Vitor Silva

+ Development Team:
-Carlos Reinis
- Camila
- Breno Morais
- Alvaro Emanuel
+ Design Team:
-Carlos Reinis
- Victor Silva

### Process

Regarding the organization and distribution of project tasks, the team uses the Trello platform, where it is possible to create Lists, Cards, Labels, Custom Buttons with automatic actions, among several other functionalities that positively impact the group's efficiency.

Our Trello desktop is organized as follows:

- `Resources for Projects`: keeps all important information about the project as a whole, this List contains links to our Google Drive, GitHub, MarvelApp, Trello itself, weekly meeting with the advisor, and possible important notices.

- `To do`: Receives all tasks to be performed in the current stage, each one of them having its own description of tips on how to carry it out, ideas of what to add in content, deadline and labels stating their priority.

- `In development`: This list shows all the tasks that are being developed, and each task will contain the name of the member and the date he assigned it, and it can contain one or more members in the same task.

- `Completed`: Here are the completed tasks, serving as a history of what has already been done, containing the completion date and who revised it.

Such lists are available in the development workbench in the Trello project management tool, it is available at the URL https://trello.com/b/TMofVulh , shown, in its current state, in the following Figure:

### Tools

The tools used in the project are:

- Canva.
- Marvel.
- GitHub.
- Git.
- Microsoft Teams.
- Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio Code was chosen because it has an integration with
Very easy to use GitHub. The Microsoft Teams used have
similar integration and therefore were selected. Finally, to create
diagrams we used Marvel, to better capture the
needs of our solution.
