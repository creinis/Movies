The header area features the company's logo; link to homepage, link to movie search engine; photo of user logged in and logout. When the user is not logged in the user photo area and logout becomes a link to the login screen.

The central and main area has different attributions in the different pages of the site, being the main area of navigation of the user, as well as, log-in; user profile creation; presentation of the user profile and editing of information; search area for movies and series and presentation of search results; Detailed information on movies and series and carousel of movie and series titles, among other features that will be detailed on the screens below.

The footer area has a copyright notice and links to the main social networks: Facebook; Twitter; Instagram and Linkedin.

For the visual identity, a simple, light and fluid design was chosen and the color palette shown below in figure xx.
